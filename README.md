### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 I am a machine learning researcher with almost 4 years of experience in the field of deep learning and healthcare. I am currently doing research at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, MA where I use Deep Learning to solve problems in healthcare. My current project is in unsupervised domain adaption in medical imaging.

Passionate in solving real-world challenges with Machine learning, data science, and robotics.

I am also a CS graduate student at Tufts University, worked on deep Reinforcement Learning, and NLP projects.

####  Throughout my career, I have valuable experience in:
- Research (14+ peer-reviewed publications)
- Python, Java, and C/C++
- Developing and deploying machine learning and deep learning models (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn)
- Application development(Android, version control)

I am an enthusiastic person always loves to explore anything that excites me.
Feel free to reach out to me about anything!
